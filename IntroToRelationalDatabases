#Compare and contrast spreadsheets and databases by following the steps below:

#Download the Rockbuster “actor.csv” file and open it in Excel.
#Drawing on what you’ve learned in previous Achievements, use the appropriate functions in Excel to count all the actors whose first name is “Ed.” Write down the result in a text document.
#Launch pgAdmin 4, open the Query Tool, copy-paste the SQL statement below into the Query Editor, and execute it. If you’re unsure how to do this, reread the “Bonus Content: Walkthrough of PostgreSQL pgAdmin 4" section of the Exercise. The Query Tool and Execute/Refresh buttons may look different in your pgAdmin 4 console (i.e., not a lightning bolt) depending on which version you’re using.

   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM actor
   WHERE first_name = 'Ed'
   
#To answer the next set of questions, you’ll be pasting the queries provided into the Query Editor in pgAdmin 4. Note down your answers in your running text document.
#Execute the following query and list the names of the columns in the payment table.
   
   
   SELECT * FROM payment LIMIT 10;

#Under the “table_name” column, what are the names of the tables that are available in the Rockbuster database? (List all names.)
   
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
   
#Within the pgAdmin 4 console, can you think of another way to list all the table names in the database instead of the SQL statement above?
#Analyze the rental duration distribution. How many days are most films rented for?
   
   SELECT rental_duration AS "rented for (in days)", COUNT(*) AS "number of films"
   FROM film
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2
